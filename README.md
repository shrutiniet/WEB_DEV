**Static Website:**
A static website consists of web pages that are fixed and display the same content to all users. The content of a static website remains unchanged unless manually updated by a web developer.

A dynamic website, on the other hand, generates content dynamically and can vary the information displayed based on user input, preferences, or other factors. Dynamic websites are built using server-side scripting languages, database systems, and other technologies.
