History of Web
Tim Berners-Lee created HTML in late 1991 but didn't release it officially. He published it later in 1995 as HTML 2.0. The idea behind creating the Web was to create a service that helps everyone communicate, share, and receive information. Then came HTML 4 which served as a major version of HTML. HTML has evolved very much and received various updates since its creation. With each version, the creation of webpages got easier and stylish.
HTML is generally used to design the basic structure of the webpages, which will be then improved using other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS controls the looks, feel, layout and formatting, whereas JavaScript is used to control different elements' behaviour on the page.
